      "**CORE TASK:**\n",
      "1.  Strictly identify atomic claims made *only* within the `response` text.\n",
      "2.  Strictly identify atomic claims made *only* within the `context` text (i.e., not mentioned in the `response`).\n",

      "3.  **Analyze Context ONLY:** Now, read the `context` text. Identify all distinct, atomic factual claims within it. List these internally.\n",
      "4.  **Identify `context_only_claims`:** Compare the full list of context claims (from Step 3) with the finalized `response_claims` list (from Step 2). Create the `context_only_claims` list by including only those context claims that are *NOT* present in `response_claims`.\n",
      "5.  **Verify `response_claims` against Context:** For *each* claim in the `response_claims` list (from Step 2), check if the `context` text fully supports it.\n",

      "    *   Populate `supported_response_claims` and `unsupported_response_claims` based *only* on this verification of `response_claims`.\n",
      "6.  **Generate Justifications for `response_claims`:** For *each* claim in `response_claims`, write a brief justification explaining *why* it is supported or unsupported, referencing the context comparison. Populate the `justifications` dictionary. **CRITICAL: Keys in this dictionary MUST exactly match the strings in the `response_claims` list.**\n",
      "7.  **Count `response_claims`:** Count the total number of claims in the `response_claims` list (`num_total_response_claims`). Count the number of claims in the `supported_response_claims` list (`num_supported_response_claims`). Prepare the justification strings for these counts.\n",
      "8.  **Outline Reasoning (Chain of Thought):** Describe the *exact* steps you took, emphasizing the separation of response analysis (Steps 1-2) from context analysis and comparison (Steps 3-7). Detail *what* claims were identified in the response *before* mentioning context analysis. Explain the verification process for *each* response claim. Populate the `chain_of_thought` field.\n",

      "3.  **Analyze Context ONLY:** Now, read the `context` text. Identify all distinct, atomic factual claims within it. List these internally.\n",

      "5.  **Verify `response_claims` against Context:** For *each* claim in the `response_claims` list (from Step 2), check if the `context` text fully supports it.\n",

      "    *   Populate `supported_response_claims` and `unsupported_response_claims` based *only* on this verification of `response_claims`.\n",
      "6.  **Generate Justifications for `response_claims`:** For *each* claim in `response_claims`, write a brief justification explaining *why* it is supported or unsupported, referencing the context comparison. Populate the `justifications` dictionary. **CRITICAL: Keys in this dictionary MUST exactly match the strings in the `response_claims` list.**\n",
      "7.  **Count `response_claims`:** Count the total number of claims in the `response_claims` list (`num_total_response_claims`). Count the number of claims in the `supported_response_claims` list (`num_supported_response_claims`). Prepare the justification strings for these counts.\n",
      "8.  **Outline Reasoning (Chain of Thought):** Describe the *exact* steps you took, emphasizing the separation of response analysis (Steps 1-2) from context analysis and comparison (Steps 3-7). Detail *what* claims were identified in the response *before* mentioning context analysis. Explain the verification process for *each* response claim. Populate the `chain_of_thought` field.\n",
